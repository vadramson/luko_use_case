luko Case Study

In this mini project, I had to do some research about how insurance pricing works.

What are they various parameters that are used to calculate home insurance pricing.

After understanding how insurance pricing works, I proceeded in searching for data that could be used to complement/optimize product pricing(_this was the most difficult part of the project_).

I modelled a DB using Sybase PowerDesigner

I scraped the websites using 

	- request_html
	- pandas' read_html (_which implicitly uses Beautifulsoup_)
	
I used pandas to clean the data and store it in postgreSQL database (_version 12.4_)
